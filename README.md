# talib-build

Build [TA-Lib](https://github.com/ta-lib/ta-lib-python) wheels for Python on Windows using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build/actions/workflows/wheel.yml).

This is a fork of the [cgohlke/talib-build](https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build) repository. The key difference is that build files are included in this repository to facilitate easier installation.
